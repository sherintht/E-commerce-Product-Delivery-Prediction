# E-commerce-Product-Delivery-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a product will be delivered on time, helping companies optimize logistics, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience. By analyzing key factors affecting delivery performance, our models aim to provide actionable insights for better decision-making.
he goal is to:

Improve customer satisfaction

Optimize logistics and supply chain operations

Identify and mitigate factors leading to delivery delays

📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in an Excel file and contains various features such as order date, shipment mode, delivery time, customer location, etc.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Several classification models were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC AUC Score & ROC Curve

🔧 Tools and Libraries
The project makes use of the following Python libraries:

📦 Data Handling & Processing
pandas, numpy

📊 Data Visualization
